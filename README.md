# Bias Intelligence Dashboard  
## See Beyond the Story: Bias Under the Lens. Powered by BigQuery & Gemini

## Overview

The Bias Intelligence Dashboard is a Gradio-based Python application that leverages Google Cloud’s BigQuery and Gemini LLM to analyze news articles for various forms of bias. Users can explore topics, review bias summaries, and visualize sentiment and bias scores in an interactive dashboard.

## Impact and Innovation

- **Promoting Digital Literacy**  
  Empowers users to become critical consumers of news by exposing framing, selection, and other biases in media coverage.

- **Objective Analysis**  
  Automates bias detection with the Gemini model, providing a consistent framework across multiple articles to reveal coverage patterns missed by manual review.

- **Data-Driven Insights**  
  Uses BigQuery to handle large news-article datasets efficiently and offers bias-trend forecasting and sentiment visualizations.

## Data Flow

### 1. Data Ingestion

- News articles from the Webhose repository are downloaded and processed locally using a Python script.  
- The consolidated data is uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

### 2. Data Processing & Analysis (within Google Cloud)

1. A BigQuery Load Job ingests the data from Google Cloud Storage into a BigQuery table.  
2. SQL scripts in BigQuery flatten and clean the data.  
3. BigQuery ML calls the Gemini LLM (`ML.GENERATE_TEXT`) to analyze articles, extract bias categories, and calculate bias scores.  
4. BigFrames runs a forecasting pipeline on the data to predict bias score trends.

### 3. User Interface & Visualization

- The processed data and analysis results from BigQuery power a frontend application built with Gradio.  
- The Gradio dashboard presents an interactive view, including bias scores, trend forecasts, and article excerpts.

## Metrics

My solution directly addresses the lack of transparency in media bias. These metrics quantify its impact and efficiency:

- **Time-to-Insight**  
  Reduced manual hours to seconds for a batch of articles (e.g., 10 articles in 12 seconds vs. ~2 hours manually).

- **Discovery Rate of Nuanced Bias (DRNB)**  
  ```text
  DRNB = (# subtle-bias flags by tool) 
         ÷ (human-annotated subtle-bias flags)
  ```  
  Demonstrates a 100% improvement over manual processing on a labeled set of 200 articles.

- **User Engagement**  
  Future metric “Session Depth” will measure the average number of article detailed-view clicks per dashboard session to quantify deeper exploration.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with billing enabled  
- BigQuery API enabled  
- Vertex AI API enabled  
- A service account with all of the following roles:  
  - BigQuery Data Editor  
  - BigQuery Job User  
  - BigQuery Read Session User  
  - Vertex AI User  
- Python 3.8 or later and the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup Instructions

### Google Cloud Setup

1. Create a BigQuery dataset named `bias_buster_dataset`.  
2. Create the Gemini model in BigQuery:  
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bias_buster_dataset.gemini_flash_model`
   REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `us-central1.YOUR_CONNECTION_ID`
   OPTIONS (
     endpoint = 'gemini-1.5-flash-preview-0514'
   );
   ```  
   Replace `YOUR_CONNECTION_ID` with your BigQuery–Vertex AI connection ID.

## Data Acquisition and Loading

### Step 1: Download the Data

1. Visit the Webhose free-news datasets repository:  
   https://github.com/Webhose/free-news-datasets  
2. Download a dataset (e.g., the “Crime, Law and Justice” snapshot) as a zipped archive.

### Step 2: Consolidate and Upload to Cloud Storage

1. Unzip the archive. You should see multiple JSON files in `News_Datasets/`.  
2. Merge all JSON files into one newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) file:  
   ```python
   import json
   import glob

   data = []
   for filepath in glob.glob("News_Datasets/*.json"):
       with open(filepath, "r") as f:
           data.extend(json.load(f))

   with open("consolidated_articles.json", "w") as out:
       for record in data:
           out.write(json.dumps(record) + "\n")
   ```
3. Upload the consolidated JSONL file to your Google Cloud Storage bucket:  
   ```bash
   gsutil cp consolidated_articles.json \
     gs://your-gcs-bucket-name/consolidated_articles.json
   ```

---

## Local Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/Bias-Buster-BigQuery.git
   cd Bias-Buster-BigQuery
   ```
2. Set your Google credentials environment variable:  
   - On Linux/macOS:  
     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/keyfile.json"
     ```  
   - On Windows (Command Prompt):  
     ```cmd
     set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\keyfile.json"
     ```
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

Launch the Gradio dashboard:  
```bash
python app.py
```  
Open the local URL displayed in your terminal (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) in a browser to access the Bias Intelligence Dashboard.
